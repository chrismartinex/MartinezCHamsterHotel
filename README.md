# MartinezCHamsterHotel
11/18/22 The Hamster Hotel remake, class assignment were we are asked to recreated an Adobe XD prototype with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
The same exact way as prototype. 

Peer Review: Freddy Aguilar
The hamster hotel website project has all the components required of it that were in the prototype. I liked how he managed to get the text boxes centered int he intro and description of the rooms. I also liked the inclusion of the logos of the calenders on the reserve a room section. On the section with the amenities the text is black and difficult to read along with the aligning of the elements therein. The ending container where the hotel logo and info is, the color is white instead of the themes navy blue type color. Some responsiveness orks and things align, but in the card section the cards come together. Overall a good project and is coming along nicely. Well done ! Keep up the good work!
